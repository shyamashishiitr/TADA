## 💀 Why Todo Apps Fail

### Common Failure Patterns:

1. **Feature Bloat**
   - Example: Wunderlist → Microsoft killed it, merged into To Do
   - Tried to compete with Asana/Trello
   - Lost core simplicity

2. **No Clear Methodology**
   - GTD? Eisenhower? Kanban? Pomodoro?
   - Apps that support "everything" feel directionless

3. **Sync/Technical Issues**
   - Any.do had major sync problems
   - Lost user trust
   - Data loss = immediate churn

4. **No Differentiation**
   - "Another todo app" syndrome
   - Why switch from what I have?

5. **Pricing Mistakes**
   - Too expensive (loses to free alternatives)
   - Too cheap (can't sustain development)
   - Weird pricing tiers

6. **Platform Lock-in**
   - Things 3 success is Apple-only, but risky
   - Web-only apps lose to native

   - Playful, confident

6. **Glass/Blur Effects**
   - macOS-style transparency
   - Depth through blur
   - Frosted glass cards

### What's Dying:
